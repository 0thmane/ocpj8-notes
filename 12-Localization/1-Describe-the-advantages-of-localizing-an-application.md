#Describe the advantages of localizing an application
Internationalization is the process of designing an application so that it can be adapted to various languages and regions without engineering changes. 

Localization is the process of adapting the content of a product to a specific region or language. Translating words is the best-known part of this process, but it is not the only part. Localization usually includes:
* Numbers
* Dates
* Currencies
* Images and sounds
* Layouts

Even in countries with the same languages, you can find differences, for example, American English vs. British English.

So the benefits of localization are:
* With the addition of localized data, the same executable can run worldwide.
* Textual elements, such as status messages and the GUI component labels, are not hardcoded in the program. Instead, they are stored outside the source code and retrieved dynamically.
* Support for new languages does not require recompilation.
* Culturally-dependent data, such as dates and currencies, appear in formats that conform to the end user's region and language.
